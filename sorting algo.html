            (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.<br> 
            The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.<br> 

<br> 1) The subarray which is already sorted.<br> 
<br> 2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.<br> 

<br> In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.<br>

        <h1><p style ="color: ghostwhite;text-align: center;text-shadow: 2px 2px"><em>Bubble Sort</em></p></h1>  
        <br>  <br>  <br>
        <h2><p style="color: floralwhite">Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements<br> if they are in wrong order.<br>

Example:<br>
<br>First Pass:<br>
<br>( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), <br>Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.<br>
<br>( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), <br>Swap since 5 > 4<br>
<br>( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), <br>Swap since 5 > 2<br>
<br>( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ),<br> Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.<br>
<br>
<br>Second Pass:<br>
<br>( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )<br>
<br>( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8), <br> Swap since 4 > 2
<br>( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>
(<br> 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>
Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed.<br> The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.<br>

<br>Third Pass:
<br>( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>
<br>( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>
<br>( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )<br>
<br>(1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )</p></h2>

        <h2><p style="color:ghostwhite"> 

<br>Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.<br> It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.<br> There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. <br>

   <br> Always pick first element as pivot.<br>
   <br> Always pick last element as pivot .<br>
   <br> Pick a random element as pivot.<br>
   <br> Pick median as pivot.<br>

<br>The key process in quickSort is partition(). <br>Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array<br> and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, <br>and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.<br></p></h2>

    <h1><p style ="color: whitesmoke;text-align: center;text-shadow: 2px 2px"><em>Heap Sort</em></p></h1>
           <br>  <br>  <br>    
        <h2><p style="color: ghostwhite">Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.<br> It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. <br>We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.<br>

<br>What is Binary Heap?<br> 
<br>Let us first define a Complete Binary Tree.<br> A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last,<br> is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible <br>
<br>A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that value in a parent node is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes.<br> The former is called as max heap and the latter is called min-heap.<br> The heap can be represented by a binary tree or array.<br>

<br>Why array based representation for Binary Heap?<br> 
<br>Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented as an array and the array-based representation is space-efficient.<br> If the parent node is stored at index I, the left child can be calculated by 2 * I + 1 and right child by 2 * I + 2 (assuming the indexing starts at 0).<br>

<br>Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in increasing order:<br> 
<br>1. Build a max heap from the input data.<br> 
<br>2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap.<br> Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1.<br> Finally, heapify the root of the tree. 
<br>3. Repeat step 2 while size of heap is greater than 1.<br>

<br>How to build the heap?<br> 
<br>Heapify procedure can be applied to a node only if its children nodes are heapified.<br> So the heapification must be performed in the bottom-up order.<br>
<br>Lets understand with the help of an example:<br>
